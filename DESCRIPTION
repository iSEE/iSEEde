Description: This package contains diverse functionality to extend the usage
    of the iSEE package, including additional classes for the panels or modes
    facilitating the analysis of differential expression results.
    This package does not perform differential expression. Instead, it provides
    methods to embed precomputed differential expression results in a
    SummarizedExperiment object, in a manner that is compatible with interactive
    visualisation in iSEE applications.
